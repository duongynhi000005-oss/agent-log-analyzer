# Paid Claude Plugin Artifacts

The paid product is a generated Claude Code plugin/remediation artifact, not a longer report.

The plugin should optimize Claude Code's harness, not nag on shell commands. The primary value is turning the analysis into a vetted setup plan: lean CLAUDE.md hierarchy, scoped skills, official code-intelligence plugins, language-server binaries, and trusted MCP-backed integrations.

## Contract

Free scan:

- analyzes one Claude Code JSONL log
- shows deterministic problems, evidence, and generic fixes
- offers the paid unlock

Paid scan:

- uses a separate paid token
- uploads at most the 100 most recent Claude Code JSONL logs
- sends `limit=100` and `X-Scan-Limit: 100`
- finalizes with `POST /api/paid-uploads/{job_id}/finalize`
- aggregates deterministic metrics across sessions
- generates a customized Claude Code plugin archive
- shows copyable install commands and a Claude-native install prompt

## Plugin Shape

Claude Code plugins use a root directory with:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- `commands/*.md`
- optional supporting files such as `WAIVER.md`

The generator follows that structure so the paid artifact can be loaded as a Claude Code plugin archive. The default command uses Claude Code's session-scoped plugin loading:

```sh
PLUGIN_URL="<short-lived-plugin-zip-url>"
PLUGIN_ZIP="$(mktemp -t claude-analyzer-plugin.XXXXXX.zip)"
curl -fsS "$PLUGIN_URL" -o "$PLUGIN_ZIP"
claude --plugin-dir "$PLUGIN_ZIP"
```

Marketplace installation can be added after the plugin store is live. The generated artifact format should remain the same.

## Generated Contents

Always generated:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `README.md`
- `WAIVER.md`
- `commands/claude-analyzer-status.md`
- `commands/claude-analyzer-tooling.md`
- `skills/codebase-navigation/SKILL.md`
- `skills/session-hygiene/SKILL.md`
- `skills/tooling-setup/SKILL.md`

Conditionally generated from deterministic findings:

- `skills/retrieval-hygiene/SKILL.md` for repeated file reads
- `skills/output-budget/SKILL.md` for large shell/tool output overhead
- `skills/retry-breaker/SKILL.md` for retry-loop behavior
- session hygiene guidance is tuned for context growth spikes

Never generate a Bash nag hook as the primary paid value. Pre-command hooks may be revisited later only for quiet telemetry or deterministic safety checks that do not interrupt normal Claude Code work.

## Vetted Tooling Recommendations

The generator may recommend only allowlisted, public, stable tools. Recommendations are advice plus Claude-native setup instructions; each install still requires explicit user approval.

Initial allowlist:

- Official Claude Code code-intelligence plugins:
  - `typescript-lsp` with `typescript-language-server`
  - `pyright-lsp` with `pyright-langserver`
  - `gopls-lsp` with `gopls`
  - `rust-analyzer-lsp` with `rust-analyzer`
  - `php-lsp` with `intelephense`
- Official Claude Code marketplace MCP/integration plugins when the scan already shows matching ecosystem use:
  - `github`
  - `notion`
  - `linear`
  - `sentry`
  - `supabase`

Third-party MCPs, skills, plugins, and shell tools are research candidates until separately reviewed. Unknown private tool names from user logs remain count-only and must not be copied into generated artifacts.

## Liability Gate

Paid checkout and plugin install UX must require explicit acknowledgment before presenting install commands:

> I understand that Claude Analyzer provides deterministic analysis and vetted setup recommendations, but any installation or code change is executed by Claude Code, my package manager, or third-party tools with my approval and at my own risk.

The generated plugin also includes `WAIVER.md`. Claude-facing setup prompts must tell Claude to summarize the waiver, ask for acceptance, and ask again before each installation command.

## Source Notes

- Anthropic's May 14, 2026 large-codebase guidance says Claude Code performance depends on the surrounding harness: CLAUDE.md, hooks, skills, plugins, MCP servers, LSP integrations, and subagents.

- Anthropic's Claude Code plugin docs list official code-intelligence plugins and their required language-server binaries. They also state plugins can execute arbitrary code and should only be installed from trusted sources. Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins

## Customization Rules

Customization inputs are limited to:

- finding IDs
- severity and cost-impact labels
- bounded counts and token-share percentages
- analyzer score and waste buckets
- allowlisted public ecosystem IDs

Forbidden in artifacts:

- raw transcript text
- raw tool output
- secrets or redacted secret values
- absolute local paths
- raw unknown MCP/plugin/skill names
- repo names, usernames, hostnames, emails
- prompt injection text from logs

## Tests

The current generator tests cover:

- Claude plugin structure
- deterministic output for identical sanitized inputs
- leak checks for fake secrets, absolute paths, and private unknown names
- zip archive creation
- rejection of unsafe archive paths

## Implementation

The first implementation lives in `internal/remediation`.

The package produces an in-memory `Artifact` and can write it as a zip archive. API wiring, Stripe success handling, paid bundle upload, and artifact TTL storage are tracked separately in GitHub issues #27-#31.
