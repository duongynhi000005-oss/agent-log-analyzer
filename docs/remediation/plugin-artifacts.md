# Paid Claude Plugin Artifacts

The paid product is a generated Claude Code plugin/remediation artifact, not a longer report.

The plugin should optimize Claude Code's harness, not nag on shell commands. The primary value is turning the analysis into a vetted setup plan: lean CLAUDE.md hierarchy, scoped skills, official code-intelligence plugins, language-server binaries, and trusted MCP-backed integrations.

## Contract

Free scan:

- analyzes one Claude Code JSONL log
- shows deterministic problems, evidence, and generic fixes
- offers the paid unlock

Paid scan:

- analyzes at most the 100 most recent Claude Code JSONL logs locally
- writes a reviewable sanitized aggregate report JSON
- uploads only the sanitized aggregate report to `POST /api/paid-client-reports`
- aggregates deterministic metrics across sessions
- generates a customized Claude Code plugin archive from the sanitized aggregate report
- shows copyable install commands and a Claude-native install prompt

The public paid flow must not ask users to tar, gzip, or upload raw Claude
Code JSONL logs. Any raw-log paid bundle endpoint is legacy/internal smoke
coverage only and must require an explicit internal request path.

## Plugin Shape

Claude Code plugins use a root directory with:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- `commands/*.md`
- optional supporting files such as `WAIVER.md`

The generator follows that structure so the paid artifact can be loaded as a Claude Code plugin archive. The default command uses Claude Code's session-scoped plugin loading:

```sh
PLUGIN_URL="<short-lived-plugin-zip-url>"
PLUGIN_ZIP="$(mktemp -t agent-analyzer-plugin.XXXXXX.zip)"
curl -fsS "$PLUGIN_URL" -o "$PLUGIN_ZIP"
claude --plugin-dir "$PLUGIN_ZIP"
```

Marketplace installation can be added after the plugin store is live. The generated artifact format should remain the same.

## Generated Contents

Always generated:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `README.md`
- `WAIVER.md`
- `commands/agent-analyzer-status.md`
- `commands/agent-analyzer-tooling.md`
- `skills/codebase-navigation/SKILL.md`
- `skills/session-hygiene/SKILL.md`
- `skills/tooling-setup/SKILL.md`

Conditionally generated from deterministic findings:

- `skills/retrieval-hygiene/SKILL.md` for repeated file reads
- `skills/output-budget/SKILL.md` for large shell/tool output overhead
- `skills/retry-breaker/SKILL.md` for retry-loop behavior
- session hygiene guidance is tuned for context growth spikes

Never generate a Bash nag hook as the primary paid value. Pre-command hooks may be revisited later only for quiet telemetry or deterministic safety checks that do not interrupt normal Claude Code work.

## Vetted Tooling Recommendations

The generator may recommend only allowlisted, public, stable tools. Recommendations are advice plus Claude-native setup instructions; each install still requires explicit user approval.

Initial allowlist is maintained in `docs/remediation/token-saving-tooling-matrix.md`.

Generated recommendations now include two classes:

- official Claude Code marketplace/code-intelligence recommendations
- GitHub-hosted open-source token-saving tools that are waiver-gated and mapped to analyzer signals

Core open-source recommendations:

- `context-mode` for context defense and large tool-output compression
- `ccusage` for independent usage analysis and before/after telemetry
- `grepai` and `claude-context` for repeated-reread/retrieval problems
- `claude-token-efficient` as a minimal CLAUDE.md diff, never an overwrite
- `ccstatusline` and Claude Code Usage Monitor as out-of-context awareness tools
- `RTK (Rust Token Killer, rtk-ai/rtk)` only as an advanced shell-compression option because it rewrites shell command execution; never install npm `rtk`, which is an unrelated release/changelog package

Official Claude Code plugin allowlist:

- Official Claude Code code-intelligence plugins:
  - `typescript-lsp` with `typescript-language-server`
  - `pyright-lsp` with `pyright-langserver`
  - `gopls-lsp` with `gopls`
  - `rust-analyzer-lsp` with `rust-analyzer`
  - `php-lsp` with `intelephense`
- Official Claude Code marketplace MCP/integration plugins when the scan already shows matching ecosystem use:
  - `github`
  - `notion`
  - `linear`
  - `sentry`
  - `supabase`

Third-party MCPs, skills, plugins, and shell tools are research candidates until separately reviewed. Unknown private tool names from user logs remain count-only and must not be copied into generated artifacts.

## Liability Gate

Paid checkout and plugin install UX must require explicit acknowledgment before presenting install commands:

> I understand that Agent Analyzer provides deterministic analysis and vetted setup recommendations, but any installation or code change is executed by Claude Code, my package manager, or third-party tools with my approval and at my own risk.

The generated plugin also includes `WAIVER.md`. Claude-facing setup prompts must tell Claude to summarize the waiver, ask for acceptance, and ask again before each installation command.

## Source Notes

- Anthropic's May 14, 2026 large-codebase guidance says Claude Code performance depends on the surrounding harness: CLAUDE.md, hooks, skills, plugins, MCP servers, LSP integrations, and subagents. Source: https://claude.com/blog/how-claude-code-works-in-large-codebases-best-practices-and-where-to-start
- Anthropic's Claude Code plugin docs list official code-intelligence plugins and their required language-server binaries. They also state plugins can execute arbitrary code and should only be installed from trusted sources. Source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins

## Customization Rules

Customization inputs are limited to:

- finding IDs
- severity and cost-impact labels
- bounded counts and token-share percentages
- analyzer score and waste buckets
- allowlisted public ecosystem IDs

Forbidden in artifacts:

- raw transcript text
- raw tool output
- secrets or redacted secret values
- absolute local paths
- raw unknown MCP/plugin/skill names
- repo names, usernames, hostnames, emails
- prompt injection text from logs

## Tests

The current generator tests cover:

- Claude plugin structure
- deterministic output for identical sanitized inputs
- leak checks for fake secrets, absolute paths, and private unknown names
- zip archive creation
- rejection of unsafe archive paths

API route tests also cover the paid local-first trust boundary:

- the default paid session command points at local CLI aggregate analysis and
  `POST /api/paid-client-reports`
- the default paid session response does not mint a raw upload token or expose
  `/api/paid-uploads/`, tar/gzip commands, or raw bundle copy
- `POST /api/paid-client-reports` accepts only waiver-gated sanitized aggregate
  reports and creates a paid report job without storing an upload path
- tokenized plugin zip generation works from that sanitized aggregate report
- the legacy raw paid bundle command is available only through
  `/api/paid-sessions?legacy_raw_bundle=1` for internal smoke compatibility

## Implementation

The first implementation lives in `internal/remediation`.

The package produces an in-memory `Artifact` and can write it as a zip archive. Paid local-first report upload, local waiver-gated paid-session generation, and tokenized plugin zip download are implemented for Docker end-to-end testing. Plugin artifacts are generated on demand from the sanitized paid report and expire with the report token.

The legacy raw paid bundle upload route remains only for internal Docker smoke
coverage while the CLI paid aggregate command is integrated. It is not the
default `/api/paid-sessions` response and must not be linked from public launch
UX. Stripe success handling and any future persisted artifact storage are
tracked separately in GitHub issues #27-#31.

## Token-saving recommendation embedding (Phase A, additive)

Phase A of the token-saving recommendation engine introduces a `TokenSavingRecommendation` contract object (see `docs/remediation/token-saving-recommendation-engine.md` for the canonical schema and rule precedence). This object captures at most one primary and at most one secondary tool suggestion per analyzed session, plus the signals and dedupe state that justified each suggestion.

The recommendation object is **optional** in paid plugin artifacts. Generators may attach it to the existing artifact payload without altering the established artifact shape, and the current generator tests (plugin structure, deterministic output for identical sanitized inputs, leak checks, zip archive creation, unsafe-archive-path rejection) continue to hold because none of them require the field to be present or absent. New tests covering the embedded recommendation are introduced alongside the engine and are gated on the field actually being populated.

Refer to `docs/remediation/token-saving-recommendation-engine.md` for the full Phase A contract: input signals, dedupe-aware emission rules, `active_high` skip behavior, and the precise field layout that downstream artifacts may serialize.
